      autumn hidden bitter misty silent empty dry dark summer
      icy delicate quiet white cool spring winter patient
      twilight dawn crimson wispy weathered blue billowing
      broken cold damp falling frosty green long late lingering
      bold little morning muddy old red rough still small
      sparkling throbbing shy wandering withered wild black
      young holy solitary fragrant aged snowy proud floral
      restless divine polished ancient purple lively nameless
      adorable beautiful clean drab elegant fancy glamorous
      handsome long magnificent old-fashioned plain quaint
      sparkling ugliest unsightly angry bewildered clumsy
      defeated embarrassed fierce grumpy helpless itchy jealous
      lazy mysterious nervous obnoxious panicky repulsive
      scary thoughtless uptight worried
